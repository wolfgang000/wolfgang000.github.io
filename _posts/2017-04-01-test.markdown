### What is testing?

### How was testing implemented?

* Development loop

Design
Development
Testing

The 3 base element in every software development process at all scales are design, development and testing. Traditionally this loop
has been applied in many different ways over the years and with, with resped to testing there are 3 fases: 

# Fase 1: Manual testing

Design
Development
Manual testing

The base form of this loop is base in the manual testing of every feature that is been develop, this is the way all programmers
learn to program, first we start with one idea o designs of what is the behavior we want to impement in or system, 
write a code that fulfill that requirement and we test that manually that that requirement is fulfilled, if that is not the case we modify or code and test again, util we are satisfy with the result. This process is simple and work pretty well in very small system but as the system grows and the number of features increases testing every part of the system, so this lead to skip old test 
and only test new parts of the system, this introduce a problem because every time you change a some part of the system there is the possibility of to change some already tested behavior, and the only way to know this
