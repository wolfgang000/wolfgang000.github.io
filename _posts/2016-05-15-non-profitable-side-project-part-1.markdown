Most of proggrammers and developers if not all of them have in one point of our careers have some crazie idea for app/service/game that make some small pasive income, many of us have tried and fail to make any profit of this project, most of the time we never know of this failures because the projects have so few users that nobody notice their ausens others make a very small profict; enount to mantein the interest of developer keep investing in the project but most
of the times the passion of the developer is what keep the developer investing in the project, and them there are the people like me, a developer that wants to make a project, has the skills nesesaries and have the passion but has no idea of what to make, but that is not going to stop me, untile I find the ringth idea I want to test how much effort woud I need to make and idea into a product, maybe a product that doesnt make any profit but will give me a good estimation of how much effort woud I need when I deci to make the real one and what steps I woud need to make, "It's not about the destination; it's about the journey".

The requiriments of this project is to make MVP with and monitization strategy and at the lowest cost posible, so lets begin!

Step 1. The idea:

Since i didn't any original idea and the goal of this project is not to make money I decidet to steal the idea of one of my favorites apps Trello, for those of you who don't know trello is a really simple card base task/project manager, the basic idea is very simple so dicited to make a clone of it.

Step 2. The requeriments:

This is one is trick, at first trello locks like a really simple app but what make spacial but its have so many small feature that make useful and pleasen to use that make deficult with small features to choose, at the end I deside on the nexts:

* Board with it CRUD
* List with it CRUD
* Droup and take card bethen lists

At this point i Thounk i was finish but them I remenber that i need primiun features for the pay users, at this point I didn't want anything fancy or over complicate, so I desited to make sharable a board with other users woud be a good idea:

* Shareable Board 

Step 3. The name:

I am really bad a naming things and I think(in past) in a lot of bad names untile i come up with one that i liked "Neo-Trello", neo is the greek word for "new" so tecnicle this name means "The New Trello" but neo sounds cooler.

Step 4. The stack:

This one was the easiest one, my favorite backend stack is Python + Django + Postgres so it was a non-brainer desicion, with the frondend thou was a little diffrence, I'm a full stack developer but my weaknes is alwasys been the frontend
I have use angular 1 and 2-4 in my jop but I really didn't like any of the 2, I hear a lot of good thing about reat and vue.js, I tried vue.js and instally loved so idecidect to use it. 

Step 5. Hosting






You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
